# sql_query_extraction_and_analysis
Summary:
  -Writing basic queries: Selecting data using `SELECT` and filtering with `WHERE`.
  -Sorting and limiting results: Using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to organize output.
  -Aggregations: Using functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()` to summarize data.
  -Grouping data: Using `GROUP BY` to group rows and aggregate within those groups.
  -Joining tables: Combining data from multiple tables with `JOIN` (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL).
  -Filtering grouped data: Using `HAVING` to filter after aggregation.
  -Subqueries:Nesting queries inside other queries to get more complex results.
  -Creating and modifying tables: Using `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

Basically, I have learned how to extract, manipulate, and summarize data from databases using SQL commands.
